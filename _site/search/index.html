    "body": "At CNS we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to cnsmarine-nigeria. com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of cnsmarine-nigeria. com, download free software, request information, or subscribe to CNS Edge newsletter. CNS AND YOUR PRIVACY: We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on cnsmarine-nigeria. com are always tailored to your current, designated preferences. When you provide CNS with your name (or alias), e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you do not ‘opt out,’ CNS and CNS representatives and affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other CNS information. Representatives and affiliates may include value-added resellers and authorized training partners. Beyond its representatives and affiliates, CNS does not offer or allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties. CNS respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users. If you do not want CNS or CNS representatives to contact you, you may “opt out” of this preference at any time, whether you’re online or contacting CNS directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you’ll always have the option to opt back in and have CNS contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the section “Contact Us,” below. If you do not want CNS or CNS representatives to contact you, you may “opt out” of this preference at any time, whether you’re online or contacting CNS directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you’ll always have the option to opt back in and have CNS contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the section “Contact Us,” below. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most CNS websites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification. Personal information that you post to online forums is accessible by other forum participants. If a user elects to use our “Tell A Friend” application for forwarding a CNS e-mail to their friend or informing a friend about our website, we ask them for the friend’s name and e-mail address. CNS will automatically send the friend the specified e-mail or the specified website information. CNS will not use the friend’s information to contact them in the future. CNS MEMBERSHIP AND THE USE OF LOG FILES (COOKIES): CNS offers free membership to all cnsmarine-nigeria visitors. In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal information and preferences. This information is stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password. There is an additional “Remember me” option. By selecting it, you allow CNS to store your Member ID and password so you can access certain areas of the website without re-signing in. The sign-in information is stored until you explicitly sign out. It also allows you to return to any CNS website on subsequent visits without having to re-enter your information. CNS remembers you by placing a log file (cookie) that contains only enough information to identify you upon return visits. A “cookie” is a small line of text that is stored with your web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps CNS provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. No information, other than that found in the Membership cookie, will be accessed by any CNS system. Access to your membership information always requires both your Member ID and Password. CNS also utilizes visitor log files (cookies) and hosted tracking with our website. Once a user enters our site, a cookie follows them through their click stream path. Examples of information being collected by these cookies and the hosted tracking include the number of times a user came to our site(s), and the paths they took to get there. CNS uses the data collected from website visitor cookies and hosted tracking in aggregate form only and does not collect any personally identifiable information. Use of this information helps us better understand what users are seeking and learning at our website(s) and helps us identify potential navigation issues. We also gauge effectiveness of our communications by inserting transparent GIF images in our HTML e-mails. These GIF files are not unique identifiers and do not gather any personally identifiable information. They simply let us know the number of e-mails that have been opened. CNS &amp; SECURITY: Security is one of our highest priorities, and CNS understands that security is important to our customers as well. CNS uses the Security Zone to periodically publish security bulletins and technical briefs that provide information to customers about security issues. CONTACT US: How to update your personal information and preferences: You can help CNS maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your name, address, title, phone number, e-mail address, or your content preferences. If at any time you wish to update your information or preferences, or you prefer to stop receiving communication from CNS, feel free to contact us at any time.
